Tutorial CRUD Node.js app adatped from Sams Teach Yourself Node.js in 24 Hours by George Ornbo

Ornbo's book was written in 2012 and some things have changed slightly: Twitter Bootstrap, Jade, and Express.

So I've hacked up the example program to get it to run in 2013. Node.js, npm, MongoDB, and Mongoose work pretty much the same in 2013 as they did in 2012.
