Tutorial CRUD Node.js app adatped from Sams Teach Yourself Node.js in 24 Hours by George Ornbo

Ornbo's book was written in 2012 and some things have changed slightly: Twitter Bootstrap, Jade, and Express.

So I've hacked up the example program to get it to run in 2013. Node.js, npm, MongoDB, and Mongoose work pretty much the same in 2013 as they did in 2012.

Installing Node.js and the required packages is easy. Go to http://nodejs.org and follow the instructions. Along with Node.js install Express and Mongoose.
Installing MongoDB is more challenging. Go to http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/ and have fun.
Download this repro, call up a terminal window, CD to the connect_to_mongo directory and type 

node app.js

Then go to your browser of choice and enter this URL

http://localhost:3000/tasks

One part I have not tested is the "node_modules" directory. You might have to re-create that. Let me check and get back to you!
